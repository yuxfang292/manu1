You are an expert engineer that is skilled at building chat and data heavy interfaces to allow for data exploration.

Carefully read the user type, user flow, data points and design constraints below and develop screens to facilitate the outcomes.

User type:
The user is a compliance and regulatory change professional for banks. They need to be able to understand and explore lots of their regulations quickly and produce a summary PDF report to share their research with their stakeholders.

User flow:
A user is landed onto a chat entry point, featuring a welcome, a free text field and a set of pre configured buttons or questions
The user can enter text into the field or select a button
The screen should then present relevant financial obligation text data "cards" and their attributes
The data should be grouped initially by their broad query
The user should then be given more options to filter and explore each of the data cards and filter down the available text cards
The user may iterate through a number of filters forwards and backwards to explore to items of relevance
The filtering action should dynamically update the screen of the cards
These filters can be interacted using key word buttons or a free text
If the user uses free text it should filter using keyword data points from the user text input
The logic for filtering operates on the data points for Extracts
At any point the user can make a can make a selection of the cards to be summarised using the summarisation logic
This shows the preview of the summarisation, for user review, the user may amend the summary and once happy export it as a report to the PDF

Data points:
The data should be currently mocked and is organised into a concept of Extracts with a number of metadata attributes
The cards should take the Extract and their metadata from a to be specified DB
Keywords should be specified as a separate discrete set

Summaristation logic:
The summary should be presented in two sections with clarity to read
Overview:
A two sentence synthesised context of the grouping of extract obligation cards
Key points:
A set of bullet points, each of which is a discrete topic
Conclusion:
A final sentence that concludes the reseach
